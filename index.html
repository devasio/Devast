Then came the survivors, armed with lamps and picks. "What are you doing in my house? Get out of here!" But the villagers stayed, and <span style="color:#bcb33e;">put their lamps in the old man's house</span>. "But how is that possible? <span style="color:#bcb33e;">No one can place objects in my house except myself!"</span> And the villagers left, without a word. Several minutes later, the ghouls landed in the old man's cabin. They destroyed the walls and doors. The man felt his time coming. The ghouls approached and, one by one, <span style="color:#bcb33e;">disappeared into the lights of the Christmas neon lights.</span> The lamps were finally useful, and the old uncle shouted, "Well, that's what I was saying! <span style="color:#bcb33e;">Lamps, that's pretty but that's better when that's useful!"

<div> Remember the fundamental rule of good living in society: <span style="color:#bcb33e;">The richer you are, the richer you will become.</span> <span style="color:#bcb33e;">The extractors</span> are further proof of this. These machines will be difficult to design but once they are placed in your home, they will collect <span style="color:#bcb33e;">stone, iron, sulphide and uranium</span> without you having to leave your home! Of course, you'll have to keep them on with gasoline. For that, you would do better to fill with orange rotten. <span style="color:#bcb33e;">Compost could be useful.</span> For those with an<span style="color:#bcb33e;"> addiction problem</span> and a pale pink head, you will need to look for a <span style="color:#bcb33e;">flower to create an antidote</span>. Be careful, this flower is extremely rare (only one on the whole map), let's hope it doesn't spawn in town!
You have also found a way to collect these <span style="color:#bcb33e;">acorns</span> that have been taunting you for so long in the branches of trees. Well done! <span style="color:#bcb33e;">You can eat them... or plant your own forest</span>

<div>The weather cools down and <span style="color:#bcb33e;">mushrooms</span> multiply in the forest. Three species in particular. One of them is <span style="color:#bcb33e;">poisoned</span>. It is better not to eat it or you will see it cloudy for some time. However, it is useful for making a <span style="color:#bcb33e;">drug that will make you faster</span>. But beware of the <span style="color:#bcb33e;">withdrawal effects</span>. This medicine is extremely addictive and you will need to take it again soon. The other two mushrooms are edible and one of them will be used to make a medicine that will <span style="color:#bcb33e;">protect you from Ghouls.</span>
If you are the lazy type, and cleaning your bases bothers you, the new <span style="color:#bcb33e;">"Repair Lapabot"</span> will satisfy you. With its multi-purpose arms and 360° view, you won't have to worry about those nasty holes in your walls anymore!

The bad ghouls have been <span style="color:#bcb33e;">nerfed</span>, and will only attack from a certain number of days.
Their diversity will also make them fewer, giving you more time to build a base.
For those who think that the bases become useless, don't forget the importance of the <span style="color:#bcb33e;">low walls</span> that will allow you to attack the ghouls <span style="color:#bcb33e;">without being touched, and without leaving your base</span>, as well as the <span style="color:#bcb33e;">low doors</span>. It is also important to build several doors in opposite places. If a ghoul could destroy one of your walls, flee to the other side.
If a ghoul is chasing you, consider putting a building in a narrow path to block the road.
If a ghoul chases you around a fire, <span style="color:#bcb33e;">you can turn around it</span>, it will do the same. This will give you time to make a <span style="color:#bcb33e;">spear</span>, or <span style="color:#bcb33e;">bow</span>.
